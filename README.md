# funkopopscollector
Yet another PHP based Funko Pop collection tracker, about as bare bones as you can get, but it's functional.

Basically you can add a new Funko Pop you own - it collects the Pop number, Pop name, Pop collection, 
you can add/edit the date you bought the Pop, and add an image to it afterwards. You can edit/delete stored
pops, AND it's multi user friendly, so you and your family/friends can all use it to track their collection.

I know it's ugly, but it's highly functional, and searching works well, but the mobile version (ha!) needs
to be done/started/helped.

Just need PHP & MySQL/MariaDB and some know how to get this thing going. I forget how to add users :(
